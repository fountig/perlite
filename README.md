Ex Deo:

```
sub _nand {

	my ($a, $b) = @_;
	
	if ($a == 1 && $b == 1) {return 0;}
	else 			{return 1;}

}

```

Files need a bit of a cleanup, documentation is sorely missing right now, come back later.

Run ```alu-t.pl``` to perform all ALU tests. The .cmp files are from nand2tetris.\
This project has high aspirations, but for now it's just proof of concept.
